![Build Status](https://github.com/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi/actions/workflows/qa.yml/badge.svg) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi)

A temporary email service and API built in Go. No JavaScript. No tracking. No analytics. No bullshit.

Check it out here: https://burner.kiwi

## About

Burner.kiwi is designed to be an easy to use, fast, and lightweight temporary mail service. It purposefully doesn't include tracking code, analytics, or advertising and has a beautiful and responsive UI.

For those wanting to self-host, burner.kiwi is designed to be able to run on both AWS Lambda and normal machines. It has several backing database implementations and can be flexibly configured.

There are three production-ready database implementations: DynamoDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite3.

There are also two email implementations: Mailgun and SMTP. SMTP allows you to receive emails directly at no extra cost but will not work with AWS lambda.

This is project still a work in progress, if you think you can help, see the To Do section.

## Deploy Your Own!

To run burner.kiwi yourself, you can build a binary or use the [official docker image](https://github.com/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi/pkgs/container/burner.kiwi).

## Build

To perform a build you must have [minify](https://github.com/tdewolff/minify/tree/master/cmd/minify) installed, and a working go installation.

```bash
make build
```

Or if you wish to use SQLite3 you must run (this enables CGO for sqlite, the binary produced is capable of connecting to any database):

```bash
make build-sqlite
```

## Test

Run all of burner.kiwi's tests locally:

```bash
make test
```

## Configuration Parameters

These are all set as environment variables.
