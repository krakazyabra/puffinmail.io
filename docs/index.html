    <h1>puffinmail.io - FAQ</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is puffinmail.io?</h3>
    <p>
        puffinmail.io is a temporary mail service. It gives you an email inbox and will allow you to receive email
        at the address for 30 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>What is wrong with all the other temporary mail services?</h3>
    <p>
        They tend to be slow, have terrible UI, have lots of ads and trackers, and transfer 10x the amount of data that
        puffinmail.io does.
    </p>

    <h3>What is puffinmail.io built with?</h3>
    <p>
        puffinmail.io is built in pure Go. It doesn't use any JavaScript and uses custom built css.
    </p>

    <h3>What kind of server is puffinmail.io running on?</h3>
    <p>
        puffinmail.io is currently deployed on kubernetes cluster running in Hetzner, Germany.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is Smoking puffin?</h3>
    <p>
        Puffin is the mascot of puffinmail.io. He is smoking pipe</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>How long do my email messages live in your database?</h3>
    <p>
        Emails live only as long as your inbox does, plus a bit more. All email messages have an expiry set to the same
        time as your inbox. After they expire, they are marked for deletion and are typically deleted within 1 hour.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you read my messages or otherwise harvest the content?</h3>
    <p>
        No.
    </p>

    <h3>Really?</h3>
    <p>
        Yep. I don't look at your messages.
    </p>

    <h3>How do you make money off this then?</h3>
    <p>
        I don't. If by some miracle this takes off and server bills get out of hand, I may look for donations or sponsors.
        I promise I will never put terrible user-hostile ads on though.
    </p>

    <h3>I still don't trust you. Can I run my own puffinmail?</h3>
