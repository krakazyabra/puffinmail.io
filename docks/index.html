    <h1>burner.kiwi - FAQ</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is burner.kiwi?</h3>
    <p>
        burner.kiwi is a temporary mail service. It gives you an email inbox and will allow you to receive email
        at the address for 24 hours.
    </p>

    <h3>What is wrong with all the other temporary mail services?</h3>
    <p>
        They tend to be slow, have terrible UI, have lots of ads and trackers, and transfer 10x the amount of data that
        burner.kiwi does.
    </p>

    <h3>What is burner.kiwi built with?</h3>
    <p>
        burner.kiwi is built in pure Go. It doesn't use any JavaScript and uses custom built css.
    </p>

    <h3>What kind of server is burner.kiwi running on?</h3>
    <p>
        burner.kiwi is currently deployed on Lightsail in the us-west-2 region.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is Roger?</h3>
    <p>
        Roger is the mascot of burner.kiwi. He is a pyromaniac <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/kiwi/facts/" target="_blank">kiwi bird</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>How long do my email messages live in your database?</h3>
    <p>
        Emails live only as long as your inbox does, plus a bit more. All email messages have an expiry set to the same
        time as your inbox. After they expire, they are marked for deletion and are typically deleted within 48 hours.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you read my messages or otherwise harvest the content?</h3>
    <p>
        No.
    </p>

    <h3>Really?</h3>
    <p>
        Yep. I don't look at your messages.
    </p>

    <h3>How do you make money off this then?</h3>
    <p>
        I don't. If by some miracle this takes off and server bills get out of hand, I may look for donations or sponsors.
        I promise I will never put terrible user-hostile ads on though.
    </p>

    <p>
        Absolutely. Go check out the instructions on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi">Github page</a> for how to host your own.
